For question 3 I considered the current managers as the question says "List the manager of each department", not "managers".

For question 4, I considered the current/last department for each employee. As we have employees that moved from dep 1 to dep 2, I am considering the current/last department. Following the same logic as Q3, the question says "List the department" not "departments".

For question 6 and 7, I followed the same way of thinking: I listed all the employees currently in the Sales Department (and Development Department, for Q7).
